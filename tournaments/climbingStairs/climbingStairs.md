You are climbing a staircase that has  `n`  steps. You can take the steps either  `1`  or  `2`  at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

Example

-   For  `n = 1`, the output should be  
    `climbingStairs(n) = 1`;
    
-   For  `n = 2`, the output should be  
    `climbingStairs(n) = 2`.
    
    You can either climb  `2`  steps at once or climb  `1`  step two times.
    

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] integer n**
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`.
    
-   **[output] integer**
    
    -   It's guaranteed that the answer will fit in a  `32`-bit integer.
