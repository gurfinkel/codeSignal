Count the number of different edges in a given undirected graph with no loops and multiple edges.

Example

For

the output should be  `graphEdges(matrix) = 2`.

Here's how the given graph looks like:

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] array.array.boolean matrix**
    
    Adjacency matrix  of the given graph.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `3 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10`,  
    `matrix[i].length = matrix.length`.
    
-   **[output] integer**
