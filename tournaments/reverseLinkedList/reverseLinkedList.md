_Note: Your solution should have O(l.length) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview._

Given a singly linked list, reverse and return it.

Example

For  `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output should be  
`reverseLinkedList(l) = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] linkedlist.integer l**
    
    A singly linked list of integers.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `0 ≤ l.length ≤ 10^5`,  
    `-10^9  ≤ l.value ≤ 10^9`.
    
-   **[output] linkedlist.integer**
    
    Reversed  `l`.
