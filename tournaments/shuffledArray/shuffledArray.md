A noob programmer was given two simple tasks: sum and sort the elements of the given array  
`a = [a1, a2, ..., an]`. He started with summing and did it easily, but decided to store the sum he found in some random position of the original array which was a bad idea. Now he needs to cope with the second task, sorting the original array  `a`, and it's giving him trouble since he modified it.

Given the array  `shuffled`, consisting of elements  `a1, a2, ..., an, a1  + a2  + ... + an`  in random order, return the sorted array of original elements  `a1, a2, ..., an`.

Example

-   For  `shuffled = [1, 12, 3, 6, 2]`, the output should be  
    `shuffledArray(shuffled) = [1, 2, 3, 6]`.
    
    `1 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 12`, which means that  `1`,  `3`,  `6`  and  `2`  are original elements of the array.
    
-   For  `shuffled = [1, -3, -5, 7, 2]`, the output should be  
    `shuffledArray(shuffled) = [-5, -3, 2, 7]`.
    

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] array.integer shuffled**
    
    Array of at least two integers. It is guaranteed that there is an index  `i`  such that  `shuffled[i] = shuffled[0] + ... + shuffled[i - 1] + shuffled[i + 1] + ... + shuffled[n]`.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `2 ≤ shuffled.length ≤ 104`,  
    `-5 · 104  ≤ shuffled[i] ≤ 5 · 104`.
    
-   **[output] array.integer**
    
    -   A sorted array of  `shuffled.length - 1`  elements.
