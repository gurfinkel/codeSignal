The  _look-and-say sequence_  is defined as follows:

-   Its first term is equal to  `1`.
-   The  `nth`  term (for  `n > 1`) is generated by reading the  `(n-1)th`  term.

Thus,

-   the second term is  `11`, generated by reading the first term as  `"One 1"`  (There is one  `1`  in previous term);
-   the third term is  `21`, generated by reading the second term as  `"Two 1"`;
-   the fourth term is  `1211`, generated by reading the third term as  `"One 2 One 1"`;

and so on.

Given some element of the  _look-and-say sequence_, generate the next one.

Example

-   For  `element = "1"`, the output should be  
    `lookAndSaySequenceNextElement(element) = "11"`;
-   For  `element = "1211"`, the output should be  
    `lookAndSaySequenceNextElement(element) = "111221"`.
