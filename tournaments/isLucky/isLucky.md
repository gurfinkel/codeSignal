Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered  _lucky_  if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number  `n`, determine if it's  _lucky_  or not.

Example

-   For  `n = 1230`, the output should be  
    `isLucky(n) = true`;
-   For  `n = 239017`, the output should be  
    `isLucky(n) = false`.
