Determine if a number can be expressed as a sum of some consecutive positive integers.

**Example**

-   For  `n = 9`, the output should be  
    `isSumOfConsecutive(n) = true`.
    
    Explanation: It is possible to get  `n = 9`  in the following way:  `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.
    
-   For  `n = 8`, the output should be  
    `isSumOfConsecutive(n) = false`.
    

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)**
    
-   **[input] integer n**
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
    
-   **[output] boolean**
    
    -   `true`  if it is possible to express  `n`  as a sum of some (at least two) consecutive positive integers,  `false`  otherwise.
