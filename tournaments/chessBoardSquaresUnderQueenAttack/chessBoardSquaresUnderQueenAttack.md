Consider a rectangular chess board of  `a × b`squares. For each of the squares imagine a lone queen standing on that square and compute the number of squares under the queen's attack. Add all the numbers you got for each of the  `a × b`  possible queen's positions.

Example

For  `a = 2`  and  `b = 3`, the output should be  
`chessBoardSquaresUnderQueenAttack(a, b) = 26`.

Here are the squares that are under Queen attack:
