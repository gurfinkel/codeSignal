The  _NOR operation_  (also known as a  _Peirce's arrow_) is a logical operation on two logical values that produces  `true`  if and only if both operands are  `false`.

Given two booleans  `a`  and  `b`, return the value of  `a NOR b`.

Example

-   For  `a = true`  and  `b = false`, the output should be  
    `logicalNor(a, b) = false`;
-   For  `a = false`  and  `b = false`, the output should be  
    `logicalNor(a, b) = true`.
