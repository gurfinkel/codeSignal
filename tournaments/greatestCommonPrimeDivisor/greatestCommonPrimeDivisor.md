Define  _GCPD_  (Greatest Common Prime Divisor) as the largest prime number that divides both given positive integers. Your task is to find  _GCPD_  of the given integers  `a`  and  `b`.

Example

-   For  `a = 12`  and  `b = 18`, the output should be  
    `greatestCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = 3`;
-   For  `a = 12`  and  `b = 13`, the output should be  
    `greatestCommonPrimeDivisor(a, b) = -1`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] integer a**
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `2 ≤ a ≤ 150`.
    
-   **[input] integer b**
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `2 ≤ b ≤ 150`.
    
-   **[output] integer**
    
    -   _GCPD_  of  `a`  and  `b`  or  `-1`  if it doesn't exist.
