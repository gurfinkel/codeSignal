You have  `a`  apples, and your friend has  `b`  apples. You will be happy if - and only if - you both have the same number of apples.

Given integers  `a`  and  `b`, check if you will be happy after you give your friend one of your apples.

Example

For  `a = 3`  and  `b = 1`, the output should be  
`shareAnApple(a, b) = true`.
