Given a positive integer  `n`, construct a number which has a single  `1`  bit, which is at the position of the least significant  `1`  bit in  `n`.

Example

For  `n = 12`, the output should be  
`leastSignificantBit(n) = 4`.

`12 (decimal) = 1100 (binary)`.  
The least significant bit is the second from the left, so the answer is  `100 (binary) = 4 (decimal)`.
