You're a crossword fanatic, and have finally decided to try and create your own. However, you also love symmetry and good design, so you come up with a set of rules they should follow:

-   the crossword must contain exactly four words;
-   these four words should form four pairwise intersections;
-   all words must be written either left-to-right or top-to-bottom;
-   the area of the rectangle formed by empty cells inside the intersections isn't equal to zero.

Given  `4`  words, find the number of ways to make a crossword following the above-described rules. Note that two crosswords which differ by rotation are considered different.

Example

For  `words = ["crossword", "square", "formation", "something"]`, the output should be  
`crosswordFormation(words) = 6`.

The six crosswords can be formed as shown below:

```
  f                         f                             f
