Find the number of ways to express  `n`  as sum of some (at least two) consecutive positive integers.

**Example**

-   For  `n = 9`, the output should be  
    `isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 2`.
    
    There are two ways to represent  `n = 9`:  `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`  and  `4 + 5 = 9`.
    
-   For  `n = 8`, the output should be  
    `isSumOfConsecutive2(n) = 0`.
    
    There are no ways to represent  `n = 8`.
