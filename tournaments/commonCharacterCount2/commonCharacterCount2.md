Given an array of strings  `s`, find the number of common characters shared by all of the strings.

Example

For  `s = ["aabcc", "adcaa", "acdba"]`, the output should be  
`commonCharacterCount2(s) = 3`.

There are  `3`  common characters in these strings: two  `a`s and one  `c`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] array.string s**
    
    An array of strings in which each string contains only lowercase English letters.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 104`,  
    `1 ≤ s[i].length ≤ 100`.
    
-   **[output] integer**
    
    -   The number of common characters shared by all the strings in  `s`.
