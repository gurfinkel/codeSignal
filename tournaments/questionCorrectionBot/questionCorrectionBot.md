When a user asks a question on Quora, the system automatically tries to improve the question's formatting before showing it to more users. Given a question as an input string, perform formatting corrections according to the following rules:

-   Strip excessive whitespaces:
    -   Remove whitespaces at the start and end, as well as multiple spaces in a row
-   Fix spacing around punctuation:
    -   Each comma should have a trailing space, but no space preceding it
-   Questions should start with a capital letter
-   Questions should end with a single question mark (not  `0`  or more than one).

Example

-   For  `question = " this isn't a relevant question , is it??? "`, the output should be  
    `questionCorrectionBot(question) = "This isn't a relevant question, is it?"`;
-   For  `question = "Is this answer correct?"`, the output should be  
    `questionCorrectionBot(question) = "Is this answer correct?"`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)**
    
-   **[input] string question**
    
    It is guaranteed that the input string contains at least one non-whitespace character, and the first of these characters is a letter (possibly lowercase).
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `question.length â‰¤ 100`.
    
-   **[output] string**
    
    Corrected version of the question.
