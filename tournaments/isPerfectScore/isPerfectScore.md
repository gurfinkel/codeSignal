A test score is  _perfect_  if every answer is correct.

You are asked to implement a grader that checks whether a  `3`  question test score is perfect based on the correctness of answers to each of the  `3`  questions.

Example

For  `ans1 = true`,  `ans2 = true`, and  `ans3 = true`, the output should be  
`isPerfectScore(ans1, ans2, ans3) = true`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**
    
-   **[input] boolean ans1**
    
    `true`  if the answer to question 1 was correct,  `false`  otherwise.
    
-   **[input] boolean ans2**
    
    `true`  if the answer to question 2 was correct,  `false`  otherwise.
    
-   **[input] boolean ans3**
    
    `true`  if the answer to question 3 was correct,  `false`  otherwise.
    
-   **[output] boolean**
    
    `true`  if the total score is perfect,  `false`  otherwise.
