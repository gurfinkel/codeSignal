One little variable has a friend he looks up to. Your task is to help this little variable become just like him! The thing is, the little variable's friend doesn't want anyone to be his copy, so after the little variable becomes like him, he saddens and becomes  `0`.

Example

For  `hero = 7`  and  `little_variable = 3`, the output should be  
`littleVariable(hero, little_variable) = 7`.
