You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer  `n`. Take its binary representation, split bits into it in pairs (bit number  `0`  and  `1`, bit number  `2`  and  `3`, etc.) and swap bits in each pair. Then return the result as a decimal number.

Example

-   For  `n = 13`, the output should be  
    `swapAdjacentBits(n) = 14`.
    
    `1310  = 11012  ~> {11}{01}2  ~> 11102  = 1410`.
    
-   For  `n = 74`, the output should be  
    `swapAdjacentBits(n) = 133`.
    
    `7410  = 010010102  ~> {01}{00}{10}{10}2  ~> 100001012  = 13310`.  
    Note the preceding zero written in front of the initial number: since both numbers are 32-bit integers, they have  `32`  bits in their binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter, so they are omitted. Here, however, it does make a difference.
