A string is said to be a  _correct sentence_  if it starts with the capital letter and ends with a full stop (`.`).

Given a string, check whether it represents a  _correct sentence_.

Example

-   For  `inputString = "This is a correct sentence."`, the output should be  
    `isCorrectSentence(inputString) = true`;
-   For  `inputString = "this is an incorrect sentence."`, the output should be  
    `isCorrectSentence(inputString) = false`;
-   For  `inputString = "This is another incorrect sentence"`, the output should be  
    `isCorrectSentence(inputString) = false`.
