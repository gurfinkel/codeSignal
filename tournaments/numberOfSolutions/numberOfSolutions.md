The positive integer  `n`  is given. How many solutions in positive integers does the following equation have:

    1 / n = 1 / a + 1 / b ? 

Example

For  `n = 2`, the output should be  
`numberOfSolutions(n) = 3`.

_Note:_  
For  `n = 2`  solutions  `(a, b) = (3, 6)`  and  `(a, b) = (6, 3)`  are different.
