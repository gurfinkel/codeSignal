Consider the  Fibonacci sequence:  `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`

We can see that  `7`  is the smallest  `0`-based index  `k`  for which  `F(k)`  has exactly  `2`  decimal digits.  
What is the smallest index  `k`  for which  `F(k)`  has exactly  `n`  decimal digits?

Example

-   For  `n = 1`, the output should be  
    `fibonacciIndex(n) = 0`;
-   For  `n = 2`, the output should be  
    `fibonacciIndex(n) = 7`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] integer n**
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`.
    
-   **[output] integer**
