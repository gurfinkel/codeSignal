Given a  reduced  improper  fraction output it as a reduced  mixed  fraction.

Example

For  `a = [7, 2]`, the output should be  
`improperFractionToMixed(a) = [3, 1, 2]`.

Explanation:  `7/2 = 3 + 1/2`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] array.integer a**

    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `2 ≤ a[i] ≤ 25`.
    
-   **[output] array.integer**
    
    -   Array of three integers representing the reduced mixed fraction equal to  `a`  in the form  `b[0] + b[1] / b[2]`.
