For a set of points  `P`  on a plane, let's denote the set of all distinct distances between the pairs of these points as  `_distinctDistances(P)_`.

Given a sorted list  `distances`, consisting of three pairwise distinct positive integers, find the set of points  `P`  of a minimum size such that  `distances`  is a subset of  `distinctDistances(P)`  (in other words, each element of  `distances`  belongs to  `distinctDistances(P)`). Return the size of  `P`as the answer.

Example

For  `distances = [3, 4, 5]`, the output should be  
`distinctDistances(distances) = 3`.

For instance,  `P`  may consist of  `(0, 0)`,  `(0, 3)`  and  `(4, 0)`.
