Given a string consisting of lowercase English letters, find the largest square number which can be obtained by  _reordering_  the string's characters and  _replacing_  them with any digits you need (leading zeros are not allowed) where same characters always map to the same digits and different characters always map to different digits.

If there is no solution, return  `-1`.

Example

-   For  `s = "ab"`, the output should be  
    `constructSquare(s) = 81`.  
    The largest  `2`-digit square number with different digits is  `81`.
-   For  `s = "zzz"`, the output should be  
    `constructSquare(s) = -1`.  
    There are no  `3`-digit square numbers with identical digits.
-   For  `s = "aba"`, the output should be  
    `constructSquare(s) = 900`.  
    It can be obtained after reordering the initial string into  `"baa"`  and replacing "a" with  `0`  and "b" with  `9`.
