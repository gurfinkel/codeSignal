You are given an array of integers  `a`. A new array  `b`  is generated by rearranging the elements of  `a`  in the following way:

-   `b[0]`  is equal to  `a[0]`;
-   `b[1]`  is equal to the last element of  `a`;
-   `b[2]`  is equal to  `a[1]`;
-   `b[3]`  is equal to the second-last element of  `a`;
-   and so on.

Your task is to determine whether the new array  `b`  is sorted in strictly ascending order or not.

Example

-   For  `a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2]`, the output should be  `alternatingSort(a) = true`.
    
    The new array  `b`  will look like  `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is in strictly ascending order, so the answer is  `true`.
    
-   For  `a = [1, 4, 5, 6, 3]`, the output should be  `alternatingSort(a) = false`.
    
    The new array  `b`  will look like  `[1, 3, 4, 6, 5]`, which is not in strictly ascending order, so the answer is  `false`.
