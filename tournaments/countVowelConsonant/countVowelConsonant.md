You are given a string  `s`  that consists of only lowercase English letters. If vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') are given a value of  `1`  and consonants are given a value of  `2`, return the sum of all of the letters in the input string.

Example

-   For  `s = "a"`, the output should be  
    `countVowelConsonant(s) = 1`;
    
-   For  `s = "abcde"`, the output should be  
    `countVowelConsonant(s) = 8`.
    
    The letters in  `s`, converted to  `1`s and  `2`s and added together as described above:  `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8`.
