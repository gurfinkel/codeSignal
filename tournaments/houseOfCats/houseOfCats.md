There are some people and cats in a house. You are given the number of legs they have all together. Your task is to return an array containing every possible number of people that could be in the house  _sorted in ascending order_. It's guaranteed that each person has  `2`legs and each cat has  `4`  legs.

Example

-   For  `legs = 6`, the output should be  
    `houseOfCats(legs) = [1, 3]`.
    
    There could be either  `1`  cat and  `1`  person (`4 + 2 = 6`) or  `3`  people (`2 * 3 = 6`).
    
-   For  `legs = 2`, the output should be  
    `houseOfCats(legs) = [1]`.
    
    There can be only  `1`  person.
    

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] integer legs**
    
    The total number of legs in the house. It's guaranteed,that this number is even.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `0 â‰¤ legs < 50`.
    
-   **[output] array.integer**
    
    -   Every possible number of people that can be in the house.
