John has always had trouble remembering chess game positions. To help himself with remembering, he decided to store game positions in strings. He came up with the following position notation:

-   The notation is built for the current game position row by row from top to bottom, with  `'/'`separating each row notation;
-   Within each row, the contents of each square are described from the leftmost column to the rightmost;
-   Each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names (`'P'`  = pawn,  `'N'`  = knight,  `'B'`  = bishop,  `'R'`  = rook,  `'Q'`  = queen,  `'K'`  = king);
-   White pieces are designated using upper-case letters (`"PNBRQK"`) while black pieces use lowercase (`"pnbrqk"`);
-   Empty squares are noted using digits  `1`  through  `8`  (the number of empty squares from the last piece);
-   Empty lines are noted as  `"8"`.

For example, for the initial position (shown in the picture below) the notation will look like this:

`"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR"`

After the white pawn moves from  `e2`  to  `e4`, the notation will be as follows:

`"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR"`

John has written down some positions using his  `notation`, and now he wants to rotate the board  `90`degrees clockwise and see what notation for the new board would look like. Help him with this task.

Example

For  `notation = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR"`, the output should be  
`chessNotation(notation) = "RP4pr/NP4pn/BP4pb/QP4pq/K2P2pk/BP4pb/NP4pn/RP4pr"`.

The notation corresponds to the initial position with one move made (white pawn from  `e2`  to  `e4`).  
After rotating the board, it will look like this:

So, the notation of the new position is  `"RP4pr/NP4pn/BP4pb/QP4pq/K2P2pk/BP4pb/NP4pn/RP4pr"`.

Input/Output

-   **[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)**
    
-   **[input] string notation**
    
    Game position in John's notation. It is guaranteed that  `notation`  is correct, but not guaranteed that it represents a valid game position.
    
    _Guaranteed constraints:_  
    `15 ≤ notation.length ≤ 71`.
    
-   **[output] string**
    
    -   Notation for the position of the game board, rotated  `90`  degrees clockwise.
